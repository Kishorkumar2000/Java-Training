3) Which of the following lines will compile without warning or error. 

1) float f=1.3;
2) char c="a";
3) byte b=257;
4) boolean b=null;
5) int i=10;

	1) float f=1.3; --> will compile without warning or error but, It will not print the value of the f is we try to print it.

	2) char c="a"; ---> It will show warning or error while we try to print it, because Here we need to use ('a') for character instead of ("a").

	3) byte b=257; ----> It will show warning or error when we try to print it, because here bytr value is 257, but the byte value should be less 
	than 128 (2^n-1)
